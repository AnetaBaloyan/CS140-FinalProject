# CS140 Final Project
**Project Objective:** The project aims at design and simulation of a mechanical converter that converts binary representation of a number into its value in the decimal numeral system. The input consists of 8 signals representing bits – 1 if a signal is recorded, and 0 – if the signal is missing. The device generates a spring oscillation the frequency of which corresponds to the magnitude of the recorded input.

I am still reading the textbooks.

My plan: 
1. Make some kind of spring system, that will be connected according to the bits. Each bit (part of the system that is responsible for a single bit) will be generating a fixed and known periodic motion. An idea for this part is I could have bits with different stiffnesses, e.g. bit 1 -- *k*, bit 2 -- *2k*, bit 3 -- *3k*, etc.
2. Once given a binary representation of a number, that spring system will generate certain complex movement/ocillations, that will be weird at first.
3. But once we run Fourier Transform on the resulting movement function generated by the spring system, we will get some coefficients. 
4. Those coefficents will be connected to the original functions that each bit was generating separately. Thus, I don't know how yet, but we will be able to do some math and get the decimal representation of the binary number.
5. This is all I have, I have no idea how to proceed.
